# Welcome! *rt2_assignment_1*

Repository for the First Assignment in Research Track part 2 - Robotics Engineering - UniGe. Here are two variants of the project [proposed here](https://github.com/CarmineD8/rt2_assignment1). See also [programmatoroSeduto/rt2_assignment_1 on GitHub](https://github.com/programmatoroSeduto/rt2_assignment_2), another update upon this project which uses ROS1 alongside with Jupyter Notebooks.

## Branch *action*

See [branch action](https://github.com/programmatoroSeduto/rt2_assignment_1/tree/action#rt2-assignment-1---branch-action). Implementation of the motion planning algorithm as a ROS1 action, and integration with CoppeliaSim for simulating the robot. 

## Branch *ros2*

See [branch ros2](https://github.com/programmatoroSeduto/rt2_assignment_1/tree/ros2#rt2-assignment-1---branch-ros2). Combination of ROS1 nad ROS2 together using [ROS1 Bridge](https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge) with [simple_bridge](https://github.com/programmatoroSeduto/simple_bridge#ros1-bridge-support----a-c-overlay-for-ros-bridge).
